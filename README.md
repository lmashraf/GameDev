Used libraries:
SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mix, OpenGL, HGE, ...

Contains:

- BlackBird Shooter: 
It's a skeleton of a typical shoot'em up game made using Haaf's Game Engine. Pretty much based on a tutorial but written rather OO.

- Unlimited H Works:
A 2D game engine written from scratch using SDL libraries. It contains most functionalities needed to make an adventure/platform game: image and surfaces blitting, sprite animations, entities management (player/enemy), area-map-tiles management, music and soundbanks, application states, collisions, ... What I'd wish to add are other basic functionalities such as a pause state which might be tricky, a savegame option, typical in-game dialog boxes using SDL_ttf, and other minor additions.
