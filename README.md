Unlimited H Works:
==================

A 2D game engine written from scratch using SDL libraries. It contains most functionalities needed to make an adventure/platform game: image and surfaces blitting, sprite animations, entities management (player/enemy), area-map-tiles management, music and soundbanks, application states, collisions, ... What I'd wish to add are other basic functionalities such as a pause state which might be tricky, a savegame option, typical in-game dialog boxes, and other minor additions.

Used libraries:
SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mix, OpenGL, HGE...
